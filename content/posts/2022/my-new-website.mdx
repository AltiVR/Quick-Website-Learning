## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this new site!
Built for the modernised web & this site is open-source, so feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/AltiVR/altific.net)! Do note that the website is not feature complete yet, and will get more improvements in the future.

## My Goals

* **Easily maintainable**. With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), I'm able to rapidly edit the contents on the website with minimum effort.
* **More content**. Being able to use my own website as a publishing platform for myself and much more! 

## Technologies

This site is made with various open-source technologies.

* **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**. This is the framework responsible for static generation and routing.
* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**. A declarative JavaScript component framework. Although, I use **[preact](https://preactjs.com/)** on client side to reduce bundle size ðŸ˜‰
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. The CSS framework based on utility classes.
* **[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)**. Git-based **Content Management System** (CMS) that allows me to rapidly edit my site's content and preview it in real-time.

## Costs?

**Â£0.00 / $0.00 etc.** Well, almost... The website is hosted for free on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Although, I have to pay for my [Domain](https://domains.google/).

## Conclusion

There isn't much else to write here, however I hope you enjoy this new site based off of Cubxity open-source [Github](https://github.com/cubxity/) :). Got some thoughts or feedback? Let me know on [Discord](CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT: https://profile.altific.net/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/altific)!
