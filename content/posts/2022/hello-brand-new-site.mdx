## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my newly polished site, built for the modern web! This site is open-source, so feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cubxity/cubxity.dev)! Do note that the website is not feature complete yet, and will get more improvements in the future.

## My Goals

* **Easily maintainable**. With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), I'm able to rapidly edit the contents on the website with minimum effort.
* **More content**. Being able to use my own website as a publishing platform for myself. 

## Technologies

This site is made with various modern open-source technologies.

* **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**. This is the framework responsible for static generation and routing.
* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**. A declarative JavaScript component framework. Although, I use **[preact](https://preactjs.com/)** on client side to reduce bundle size ðŸ˜‰
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. The CSS framework based on utility classes. This is by far, the most enjoyable framework I've ever used.
* **[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)**. Git-based **Content Management System** (CMS) that allows me to rapidly edit my site's content and preview it in real-time.

## Costs?

**$0.00.** Well, almost. The website is hosted for free on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Although, I have to pay for my domain.

## Conclusion

There isn't much to write here, however I hope you enjoy my new site :). Got some thoughts or feedback? Let me know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UUPeTMVjV7) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cubxity)!
