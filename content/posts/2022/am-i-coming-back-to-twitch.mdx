## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

So you stumbled on this because your wondering when I will begin streaming again? Well I don't know but I hope for it to be soon because I would quite enjoy doing this again, when I was streaming before I got bored because I felt obligated to keep playing Minecraft because it was the only game I saw at the time that worked for streaming. But now I'm moving on to other games, I will be returning to Minecraft but on my own servers because a lot of the server are boring sometimes like Hypixel dropped off for me, but anyways if you would like to see me when I go live then check me out! -> [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/altific)!

## My Goals

* **To Stream Better Content**. As explained above I won't be streaming Minecraft as much but I will stream so much more other games that suit me and my vybe and also hopefully play with you lovely lot!
* **More content**. Will most likely play **Genshin, Fortnite, Minecraft (Sometimes), Among Us, Roblox, And even some VR Games thrown into the mix!**
